## Hey, I'm Kristie! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my corner of the Internet! I'm a full-time dual-degree student at UC Berkeley (go bears), full-time DeFi evangelist, and, most importantly, full-time human being.

I use she/her pronouns. My curiosities include startups, crypto, diversity/equity/inclusion, and product. More recently, though, I've been thinking about wellness/happiness, solitude, and what it means to be successful. I also recently moved into my first ever apartment; please send me your Pinterest boards and favorite houseplant recommendations :)

* Trying my hardest to sit down and study EECS + Business @ UC Berkeley Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology Program.
* Tweeting all things tech + startups + crypto + DEI.
* Reading, journaling, painting, going on walks, trying to be better at being alone this quarantine season.
* Volunteering in a reading program for underserved elementary students ðŸ¥°
